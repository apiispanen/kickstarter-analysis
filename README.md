# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project analyzes Kickstarter data for playwrights. The intention is to gain a greater understanding of what makes Kickstarter campaigns truly successful, specifically in the "plays" subcategory, looking at how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to assist in the budgeting of Kickstarter data for practical application in planning. By analyzing what drives successful and failed campaigns, particularly in the "plays" subcategory, we can discover new ways to budget the project accordingly - setting appropriate goals and driving better funding to the campaign.

### Background
The dataset comes from Kickstarter, a site dedicated to crowdfunding. The year and method of collection was not noted, but the dataset was given to reflect some of the site's various collection of campaigns.  


## Analysis and Challenges
Since the data is indicative of either the "Theater" parent category or the "plays" subcategory, the analysis is not representative of all Kickstarter data. 

### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" data, we can see that there are more successful campaigns than failed ones, which is promising for a new playwright to get their campaign funded. The canceled campaigns are very low through every month relative to the successful and failed campaigns, meaning that many campaigns stick until the end. The highs outcomes for success in the Theater parent category come in the months of May, June and July, while there is a clear low value of December. December is interesting, for it is the closest point to where successful and failed campaigns intersect (but do not), indicating that there is a lot less preference to successful campaigns in December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the "Outcomes Based on Goals" data, 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the sheet "Outcomes based on Launch Date", which contains both a table and graph, we can infer the following:
    1. For sucessful Kickstarters in the "theater" parent category, May through July seem to be the best months to raise a successful campaign. In particular, May is the top month for Louise to start a campaign, since it has the highest amount of successful campaigns. Not only this, but the 2 other highest months are June and July, which are the following months. For a Kickstarter campaign, the duration may span over multiple months, and making one in this period of time may increase her liklihood of being fully funded.   
    2. It would be advisable for Louise to not schedule a campaign for December, since based on our data there is a much lower amount of successful campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the "Outcomes based on Goals", we can reason.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
To discuss limitations of the dataset, it would be first important to know the exact data we are dealing with. We do not know the exact method of extraction that the data was given to us through, so there is a possibility of bias or a skewed segment of the data being drawn. On top of this, from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/235405/kickstarter-project-funding-success-rate/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20share,gone%20into%20successfully%20launched%20projects.) 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
